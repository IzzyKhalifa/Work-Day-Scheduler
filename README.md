# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler


I created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML , CSS powered by jQuery and [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library.


## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
